# audio-tagging

Audio tagging is the process of inferring descriptive labels from audio clips. Due to the significant amount of manual effort that is involved in tasks like annotating of sound collections, there is a need for an automatic and reliable general-purpose audio tagging system. The main task addressed in this project is to develop an algorithm that can automatically recognise sounds and apply tags of varying natures. The audio dataset used for this study is provided as a part of the Freesound Audio Tagging 2019 Kaggle challenge.
